The Cyber-Physical-Systems research group (CPS) is the successor of the world-renown Real-Time-Systems group (RTS), lead by Prof. Hermann Kopetz. The CPS group was established in 2/2012, when Prof. Grosu moved from the Computer Science Department of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, USA, to Vienna, to assume the lead of the RTS group. The RTS group has played a key role in laying out the foundations and design-blueprints for Embedded Systems (ES). The main focus of the group was on:

The specification (e.g. timing constraints), 
The design (e.g. fault-tolerant time-triggered systems),
The analysis (e.g. worst case execution time), and
The control (e.g clock synchronization and scheduling)
 
of the ES' time behavior. Building on this fundament, and the work of Prof. Grosu in Germany and the US, the CPS group is now laying out the foundations and design-blueprints for the next generation of ES, the networked ES, also known as Cyber-Physical Systems. In such systems, time also interacts with space, energy, and uncertainty. The main focus of the group is now therefore on:

The specification (e.g. spatial-temporal logics),
The design (e.g. probabilistic hybrid systems),
The analysis (e.g. symbolic and stochastic model checking), and
The control (e.g. PID, supervisory, and optimal),
 
of this richer class of CPS' behaviors. The international impact of the RTS/CPS group on science and technology is documented by a large number of projects and the foundation of a company, TTTech.
