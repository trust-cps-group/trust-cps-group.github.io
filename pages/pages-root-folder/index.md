# Use the widgets beneath and the content will be

layout: frontpage
teaser: Welcome
#widget1:
#  title: "Widget No 1"
#  url: '/research/project1'
#  #image: widget-1-302x182.jpg
#  text: 'This is the description to the first widget. The link leads to our first research project.'
#widget2:
#  title: "Widget No 2"
#  url: '/research/project2'
#  text: 'The description of the second image. The link should actually lead to the second research project.'
#widget3:
#  title: "Widget No 3"
#  url: '/research/project3'
#  #image: widget-github-303x182.jpg

# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss

#  style: alert
