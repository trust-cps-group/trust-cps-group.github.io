layout: frontpage
teaser: Welcome
#widget1:
#  title: "Widget No 1"
#  url: '/research/project1'
#  #image: widget-1-302x182.jpg
#  text: 'This is the description to the first widget. The link leads to our first research project.'
#widget2:
#  title: "Widget No 2"
#  url: '/research/project2'
#  text: 'The description of the second image. The link should actually lead to the second research project.'
#widget3:
#  title: "Widget No 3"
#  url: '/research/project3'
#  #image: widget-github-303x182.jpg
#  text: 'The link should lead to the third research project.'
#
# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss

#  style: alert

# This is a nasty hack to make the navigation highlight

"Cyber-Physical Systems are engineering, physical and biological systems whose operations are integrated, monitored, and/or controlled by a computational core. Components are networked at every scale. Computing is deeply embedded into every physical component, possibly even into materials. The computational core is an embedded system, usually demands real-time response, and is most often distributed. The behavior of a cyber-physical system is a fully-integrated hybridisation of computational (logical) and physical action."
