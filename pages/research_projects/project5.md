IoT4CPS developed guidelines, methods and tools to enable safe and secure IoT-based applications for automated driving and for smart production. The project addressed safety and security aspects in a holistic approach both along the specific value chains and the product life cycles. To ensure the outreach of the project activities and results, the relevant stakeholders were involved throughout the project and results were disseminated to expert groups and standardization bodies. IoT4CPS supported digitalization along the entire product lifecycle, leading to a time-to-market acceleration for connected and autonomous vehicles. IoT4CPS provided innovative components, leading to efficiency increases for the deployment of autonomous driving functions and in smart production environments, which were validated in a vehicle and in a smart production demonstrator.
