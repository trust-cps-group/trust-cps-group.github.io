# Innovative Doctoral Training in the Heart of Europe

LogiCS@TUWien is a novel interdisciplinary EC H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie COFUND doctoral training programme for international high-potential early-stage researchers (ESRs) with a focus on Logical methods in Computer Science at the Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien)  in Vienna,  Austria.

LogiCS@TUWien will be a top international graduate program implementing a unique combination of disciplines where logical methods have a decisive impact on practical computer science and society in the coming decades. It builds upon the highly successful LogiCS program which is funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF.

As a doctoral program and a hotspot for innovative logic-related research in Europe, it will establish an internationally outstanding center of excellence for Logical Methods in Computer Science. The structure of LogiCS@TUWien reflects our faculty and doctoral supervisors’ scientific strength in Logical Methods in Computer Science and their applications, particularly to Artificial Intelligence, Databases, Verification, Algorithms, Security, Distributed and Cyber-Physical Systems.

These research topics are driven by demand from industry and real-world problems. The programme provides a 4-year long doctoral training for international PhD candidates at the Faculty of Informatics at TU Wien, offering an English language curriculum. LogiCS@TUWien will run for 60 months and foresees the recruitment of 20 PhD candidates.
