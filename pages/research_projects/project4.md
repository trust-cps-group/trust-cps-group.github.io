The research field of Resilient Embedded Systems investigates novel methods to design, verify and implement safe, secure and dependable computing architectures subject to real-time constraints. The topical span of the doctoral college covers all aspects of the direct interaction of computer systems and their environment, from the lowest level of circuit and hardware architectures to safety-critical cyber-physical systems like industrial automation, building automation & smart grids, healthcare, spacecraft, and automotive including networking infrastructures. Designing such systems is challenging, both from a scientific and technological perspective: Many functions are directly implemented in hardware for performance reasons, distributed and parallel processing is omnipresent, digital signal processing is often required, real-time and power/thermal constraints must be met, energy-efficiency is crucial, stopping operation in the case of failures is often not feasible, unique security issues and threats exist, "trial-and-error-style programming" is not an option in many applications, asserting system correctness by means of testing may be insufficient for the required dependability reliability level, emergent behavior originating from autonomous operation must be understood and controlled, integration and complexity issues created by the upcoming Internet of Things must be managed, etc.
