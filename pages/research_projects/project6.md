The LogiCS doctoral program is a PhD degree program funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF and run jointly by the three Austrian universities Vienna University of Technology, Graz University of Technology and Johannes Kepler University Linz. This program is aimed at highly motivated students who want to work in one of three fundamental fields of computer science: Logic is a powerful reasoning tool. Originally invented as an aid for sound argumentation, it reached maturity in the form of mathematical logic and analytic philosophy in the early 20th century, with significant contributions from Vienna. We continue this tradition, using logic as a tool that enables computer programs to reason about the world. These reasoning tasks allow a natural classification into two broad areas: In Databases and Artificial Intelligence, logic is used to model, store, analyze and predict information about the outside world including the Internet. In Verification, logic is used to model, analyze and construct computer programs themselves. The logical and algorithmic questions which underlie both application areas are studied in the area of Computational Logic.
