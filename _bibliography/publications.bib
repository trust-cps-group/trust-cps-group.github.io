  author = {Treml, Lilly and Bartocci, Ezio and Gizzi, Alessio},
  journal = {Mathematics},
  abstract = {The heart consists of a complex network of billions of cells. Under
      physiological conditions, cardiac cells propagate electrical signals in space,
      generating the heartbeat in a synchronous and coordinated manner. When such a
      synchronization fails, life-threatening events can arise. The inherent
      complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics and the large number of
      biological components involved make the modeling and the analysis of
      electrophysiological properties in cardiac tissue still an open challenge. We
      consider here a Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA) approach modeling the cardiac
      cell-cell membrane resistance with a free variable. We show that the modeling
      approach can reproduce important and complex spatiotemporal properties paving
      the ground for promising future applications. We show how GPU-based technology
      can considerably accelerate the simulation and the analysis. Furthermore, we
      study the cardiac behavior within a uni-dimensional domain considering
      inhomogeneous resistance and we perform a Monte Carlo analysis to evaluate our
      approach.},

  abstract = {The termination behavior of probabilistic programs depends on the outcomes of
      random assignments. Almost sure termination (AST) is concerned with the question
      whether a program terminates with probability one on all possible inputs.
      Positive almost sure termination (PAST) focuses on termination in a finite
      expected number of steps. This paper presents a fully automated approach to the
      termination analysis of probabilistic while-programs whose guards and
      expressions are polynomial expressions. As proving (positive) AST is undecidable
      in general, existing proof rules typically provide sufficient conditions. These
      conditions mostly involve constraints on supermartingales. We consider four
      proof rules from the literature and extend these with generalizations of
      existing proof rules for (P)AST. We automate the resulting set of proof rules by
      effectively computing asymptotic bounds on polynomials over the program
      variables. These bounds are used to decide the sufficient conditions - including
      the constraints on supermartingales - of a proof rule. Our software tool Amber
      can thus check AST, PAST, as well as their negations for a large class of
      polynomial probabilistic programs, while carrying out the termination reasoning
      fully with polynomial witnesses. Experimental results show the merits of our
      generalized proof rules and demonstrate that Amber can handle probabilistic
      programs that are out of reach for other state-of-the-art tools. },

  abstract = {Ensuring correctness of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is an extremely challenging
      task that is in practice often addressed with simulation-based testing. Formal
      specification languages, such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL), are used to
      mathematically express CPS requirements and thus render the simulation activity
      more systematic and principled. We propose a novel method for adaptive
      generation of tests with specification coverage for STL. To achieve this goal,
      we devise cooperative reachability games that we combine with numerical
      optimization to create tests that explore the system in a way that exercise
      various parts of the specification. To the best of our knowledge, our approach
      is the first adaptive testing approach that can be applied directly to MATLAB
      Simulink/Stafeflow models.
      We implemented our approach in a prototype tool and evaluated it on several
      illustrating examples and a case study from the avionics domain, demonstrating
      the effectiveness of adaptive testing to (1) incrementally build a test case
      that reaches a test objective, (2) generate a test suite that increases the
      specification coverage, and (3) infer what part of the specification is actually
      implemented.},

      paper we present CPSDebug, a tool for supporting designers in the debugging of
      failures in MATLAB Simulink/Stateflow models. CPSDebug implements a gray-box
      approach that combines testing, specification mining, and failure analysis, to
      identify the causes of failures and explain their propagation in time and space.
      The evaluation of the tool, based on multiple usage scenarios and faults and
      direct feedback from engineers, shows that CPSDebug can effectively aid

      Motivated by the need for powerful formal methods to reason about the

      QRE is a formal language to express complex numerical queries over data streams,

      domains) and various discriminators at the heart of today's arrhythmia detection
      devices.

  abstract = {Piecewise Barrier Tubes (PBT) is a new technique for flowpipe overapproximation
      for nonlinear systems with polynomial dynamics, which leverages a combination
      of barrier certificates. PBT has advantages over traditional time-step based
      methods in dealing with those nonlinear dynamical systems in which there is a large
      difference in speed between trajectories, producing an overapproximation that is time
      independent.
      However, the existing approach for PBT is not efficient due to
      the application of interval methods for enclosure-box computation, and it can
      only deal with continuous dynamical systems without uncertainty. In this paper, we extend
      the approach with the ability to handle both continuous and hybrid dynamical
      systems with uncertainty that can reside in parameters and/or noise.
      We also improve the efficiency of the method significantly, by avoiding
      the use of interval-based methods for the enclosure-box computation without
      loosing soundness.
      We have developed a C++ prototype implementing the proposed approach and
      we evaluate it on several benchmarks. The experiments show that
      our approach is more efficient and precise than other methods in the literature.},

      that improves considerably the load balancing, by estimating the cost of the
      post operations (both discrete and continuous), and using this estimate to
      balance the load by a task level parallelization (TP-BFS). Finally, an
      asynchronous HA exploration algorithm which removes the thread synchronization

      The CMSB annual conference series, created in 2003, provides a unique forum of
      discussion for computer scientists, biologists,  mathematicians, engineers, and
      physicists interested in a system-level understanding of biological processes.
      Topics of interest include formalisms for modeling biological processes;
      approaches for model verification, validation, analysis, and simulation;
      high-performance methods; model inference from  experimental data; model
      integration from biological databases; multi-scale modeling and analysis
      methods; and computational approaches for synthetic biology. Case studies were
      especially encouraged.

      The CMSB series of conferences has contributed to making the  biological domain
      an important test-bed of ideas for inter-disciplinary computer science
      applications and, at the same time, showing to biologists common patterns of
      circuit similarity across different areas (such as biomedical processes, animal,
      plant and bacterial physiology) and across scales.

      The conference program featured two main tracks: regular papers, and tool
      papers.  The conference received 40 submissions,  out of which 17 regular papers
      and three tool papers were chosen for presentation at the conference and
      publication in the proceedings.
      This special section contains a selection of eight papers, including the winners
      of the Best Paper and Best Student
      Paper awards. The invited papers have been significantly extended with respect
      to the proceedings version and underwent a new peer-review process.  We are

  abstract = {We address the problem of analyzing the reachable set of a polynomial nonlinear
      continuous system by
       over-approximating the flowpipe of its dynamics.
      The common approach to tackle this problem is to perform a numerical integration
      over a given time horizon based on Taylor expansion and interval arithmetic.
      However, this method results to be very conservative when there is a  large
      difference in speed between trajectories as time progresses.  In this paper, we
      propose to use combinations of barrier functions, which we call piecewise
      barrier tube (PBT), to over-approximate flowpipe.  The basic idea of PBT is that
      for each segment of a flowpipe, a coarse box which is big enough to contain the
      segment is constructed using sampled simulation and then in the box we compute
      by linear programming a set of barrier functions (called barrier tube or BT for
      short) which work together to form a tube surrounding the flowpipe. The benefit
      of using PBT is that: (a) BT is independent of time and hence can avoid being
      stretched and deformed by time; (b) a small number of BTs can form a tight
      over-approximation for the flowpipe, which means that the computation required

  abstract = {We consider the problem of monitoring a Linear Time Logic (LTL) specification
      that is defined on infinite paths, over finite traces.
      For example, we may need to draw a verdict on whether the system satisfies or
      violates the property 'p holds
      infinitely often.'  The problem is that there is always a continuation of a
      finite trace that satisfies the property and a different continuation that
      violates it.
      We propose a two-step approach to address this problem. First, we introduce a
      counting semantics that computes the number of steps to witness the satisfaction
      or violation of a formula for each position in the trace.  Second, we use this
      information to make a prediction on inconclusive suffixes.  In particular, we
      consider a good suffix to be one that is shorter than the longest witness for a
      satisfaction, and a bad suffix to be shorter than or equal to the longest
      witness for a violation. Based on this assumption, we provide a verdict
      assessing whether a continuation of the execution on the same system will
      presumably satisfy or violate the property.},

      uses Particle Swarm Optimization, with adaptive sizing for both the receding
      horizon and the particle swarm. Inspired by Importance Splitting, the length of
      the horizon and the number of particles are chosen such that at least one
      particle reaches a next-level state, that is, a state where the cost decreases
      by a required delta from the previous-level state. The level relation on states
      and the plans constructed by ARES implicitly define a Lyapunov function and an
      optimal policy, respectively, both of which could be explicitly generated by
      applying ARES to all states of the MDP, up to some topological equivalence
      relation. We also assess the effectiveness of ARES by statistically evaluating
      its rate of success in generating optimal plans. The ARES algorithm resulted
      from our desire to clarify if flying in V-formation is a flocking policy that
      optimizes energy conservation, clear view, and velocity alignment. That is, we
      were interested to see if one could find optimal plans that bring a flock from
      an arbitrary initial state to a state exhibiting a single connected V-formation.
      For flocks with 7 birds, ARES is able to generate a plan that leads to a
      V-formation in 95% of the 8,000 random initial configurations within 63 s, on
      average. ARES can also be easily customized into a model-predictive controller
      (MPC) with an adaptive receding horizon and statistical guarantees of
      convergence. To the best of our knowledge, our adaptive-sizing approach is the
      first to provide convergence guarantees in receding-horizon techniques.},

      different spatial and temporal scales. Hence, the spatial and temporal
      requirements play an essential role for their correct and safe execution.
      Furthermore, the local interactions among the system components result in global
      spatio-temporal emergent behaviors often impossible to predict at the design
      time. In this work, we pursue a complementary approach by introducing STREL a
      novel spatio-temporal logic that enables the specification of spatio-temporal
      requirements and their monitoring over the execution of mobile and spatially
      distributed CPS. Our logic extends the Signal Temporal Logic [15]with two novel
      spatial operators reach and escape from which is possible to derive other
      spatial modalities such as everywhere, somewhere and surround. These operators
      enable a monitoring procedure where the satisfaction of the property at each

      future distributed online monitoring algorithms. We propose both a qualitative
      and quantitative semantics based on constraint semirings, an algebraic structure

      only legitimate users should access any part of information they distribute

      To the best of our knowledge, the security analysis and assessment of existing

      mathematical framework to solve policy-making problems

      for these models is to efficiently compute an optimal policy
      to control the system in order to maximise the probability of satisfying a

      several advantages over the classical methods

      a black-box, and does not suffer from state-space explosion.
      The  use of a stochastic moment-based gradient ascent algorithm

      the convergence using the momentum term.  We demonstrate

      monitoring if a digital signal satisfies a metric temporal-logic (MTL)
      specification. TrueNorth spiking neurons are universal computation blocks, which
      can perform a variety of deterministic or stochastic tasks (e.g.,
      Boolean/arithmetic opera- tions, filtering, and convolution) depending on the
      configuration of their parameters. We show how to set these parameters for the
      deterministic TrueNorth neural-model in order to recognize MTL operators. A
      TrueNorth circuit then behaves as a runtime MTL monitor. We demonstrate how to
      translate the neural monitor to synthesizable HDL-code on Xilinx's Zedboard
      using high-level synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
      application of the IBM's TrueNorth model for runtime monitoring. It also
      demonstrates the complete flow from a high- level specification to the
      implementation of a neural monitor in FPGA. As a byproduct, the paper also
      introduces the first open- source FPGA implementation of the deterministic
      TrueNorth model. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a case study,

      (HA), with the goal of enhancing performance on multi-core shared-memory
      systems. The first uses the parallel, breadth-first-search algorithm (PBFS) of
      the SPIN model checker, when traversing the discrete modes of the HA, and
      enhances it with a parallel exploration of the continuous states within each
      mode. We show that this simple-minded extension of PBFS does not provide the
      desired load balancing in many HA benchmarks. The second algorithm is a
      task-parallel BFS algorithm (TP-BFS), which uses a cheap precomputation of the
      cost associated with the post operations (both continuous and discrete) in order
      to improve load balancing. We illustrate the TP-BFS and the cost precomputation
      of the post operators on a support-function-based algorithm for state-space
      exploration. The performance comparison of the two algorithms shows that, in
      general, TP-BFS provides a better utilization/load-balancing of the CPU. Both
      algorithms are implemented in the model checker XSpeed. Our experiments show a
      maximum speed-up of more than 2000 Ï‡ on a navigation benchmark, with respect to
      SpaceEx LGG scenario. In order to make the comparison fair, we employed an equal
      number of post operations in both tools. To the best of our knowledge, this

        can be viewed as linear time-invariant
        filtering, by interpreting addition, multiplication, and their
        neutral elements, over the idempotent dioid (max,min,0,1). Moreover,
        by interpreting these operators over the field of reals
        (+,$\times$,0,1), one can associate various quantitative semantics
        to a metric-temporal-logic formula, depending on the filter's kernel
        used: square, rounded-square, Gaussian, low-pass, band-pass, or
        high-pass. This remarkable connection between filtering and metric
        temporal logic allows us to freely navigate between the two, and to
        regard signal-feature detection as logical inference.

        To the best of our knowledge, this connection has not been
        established before. We prove that our qualitative, filtering
        semantics is identical to the classical MTL semantics. We also
        provide a quantitative semantics for MTL, which measures the
        normalized, maximum number of times a formula is satisfied within
        its associated kernel, by a given signal. We show that this
        semantics is sound, in the sense that, if its measure is 0, then the
        formula is not satisfied, and it is satisfied otherwise. We have
        implemented both of our semantics in Matlab, and illustrate their
        properties on various formulas and signals, by plotting their

      investigation. Specially, we perform reach-tube-based reachability analysis on
      the TW circuit model of Wicks et al. (1996) to estimate key model parameters.
      Underlying our approach is the use of Fan and Mitraâ€™s recently developed
      technique for automatically computing local discrepancy (convergence and
      divergence rates) of general nonlinear systems.
      The results we obtain are a significant extension of those of Wicks et al.
      (1996), who equip their model with fixed parameter values that reproduce the
      predominant TW response they observed experimentally in a population of 590
      worms. In contrast, our techniques allow us to much more fully explore the
      modelâ€™s parameter space, identifying in the process the parameter ranges
      responsible for the predominant behavior as well as the non-dominant ones. The

  abstract = {We present XSpeed a parallel state-space exploration algorithm for continuous
      systems with linear
      dynamics and nondeterministic inputs. The motivation of having parallel
      algorithms is to exploit the
      computational power of multicore processors to speed-up performance. The
      parallelization is achieved
      on two fronts. First we propose a parallel implementation of the support
      function algorithm by sampling
      functions in parallel. Second, we propose a parallel state-space exploration by
      slicing the time horizon
      and computing the reachable states in the time slices in parallel. The second
      method can be however
      applied only to a class of linear systems with invertible dynamics and fixed
      input. A GP-GPU implementation
      is also presented following a lazy evaluation strategy on support functions. The
      parallel algorithms are
      implemented in the tool XSpeed. We evaluated the performance on two benchmarks
      including an 28
      dimension Helicopter model. Comparison with the sequential counterpart shows a
      maximum speed-up
      of almost $7 \times$ on a 6 core, 12 thread Intel Xeon CPU E5-2420 processor.
      Our GP-GPU implementation
      shows a maximum speed-up of $12 \times$ over the sequential implementation and
      $53 \times$ over
      SpaceEx (LGG scenario), the state of the art tool for reachability analysis of
      linear hybrid systems.
      Experiments illustrate that our parallel algorithm with time slicing not only
      speeds-up performance
      but also improves precision.},

  abstract = {We introduce Runtime Verification with Particle Filtering (RVPF), a powerful and
      versatile method for controlling the tradeoff between uncertainty and overhead
      in runtime verification. Overhead and accuracy are controlled by adjusting the
      frequency and duration of observation gaps, during which program events are not
      monitored, and by adjusting the number of particles used in the RVPF algorithm.
      We succinctly represent the program model, the program monitor, their
      interaction, and their observations as a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). Our
      formulation of RVPF in terms of DBNs is essential for a proper formalization of
      peek events: low-cost observations of parts of the program state, which are
      performed probabilistically at the end of observation gaps. Peek events provide
      information that our algorithm uses to reduce the uncertainty in the monitor
      state after gaps.

      We estimate the internal state of the DBN using particle filtering (PF) with
      sequential importance resampling (SIR). PF uses a collection of conceptual
      particles (random samples) to estimate the probability distribution for the
      systemâ€™s current state: the probability of a state is given by the sum of the
      importance weights of the particles in that state. After an observed event, each
      particle chooses a state transition to execute by sampling the DBNâ€™s joint
      transition probability distribution; particles are then redistributed among the
      states that best predicted the current observation. SIR exploits the DBN
      structure and the current observation to reduce the variance of the PF and
      increase its performance.

      We experimentally compare the overhead and accuracy of our RVPF algorithm with
      two previous approaches to runtime verification with state estimation: an exact
      algorithm based on the forward algorithm for HMMs, and an approximate version of
      that algorithm, which uses precomputation to reduce runtime overhead. Our
      results confim RVPFâ€™s versatility, showing how it can be used to control the
      tradeoff between execution time and memory usage while, at the same time, being
      the most accurate of the three algorithms.},

  abstract = {We present Adaptive Runtime Verification (ARV), a new approach to runtime
      verification in which overhead control, runtime verification with state
      estimation, and predictive analysis are synergistically combined. Overhead
      control maintains the overhead of runtime verification at a specified target
      level, by enabling and disabling monitoring of events for each monitor instance
      as needed. In ARV, predictive analysis based on a probabilistic model of the
      monitored system is used to estimate how likely each monitor instance is to
      violate a given temporal property in the near future, and these criticality
      levels are fed to the overhead controllers, which allocate a larger fraction of
      the target overhead to monitor instances with higher criticality, thereby
      increasing the probability of violation detection. Since overhead control causes
      the monitor to miss events, we use Runtime Verification with State Estimation
      (RVSE) to estimate the probability that a property is satisfied by an
      incompletely monitored run. A key aspect of the ARV framework is a new algorithm
      for RVSE that performs the calculations in advance, dramatically reducing the
      runtime overhead of RVSE, at the cost of introducing some approximation error.
      We demonstrate the utility of ARV on a significant case study involving runtime
      monitoring of concurrency errors in the Linux kernel.},
