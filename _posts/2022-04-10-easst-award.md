At the 2022 European Joint Conferences (ESOP, FASE, FoSSaCS and TACAS) on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS) held in Munich (2-7 April 2022), a multi-institutional team of researchers from AIT (Dejan Nickovic), IST (Thomas A. Henzinger, Thomas Ferrere) and TU Wien (Ezio Bartocci, Ana Oliveira da Costa) has been recognized by the European Association of Software Science and Technology (EASST) with the EASST Award (Best Software Science Paper Award) for their work “Information-flow Interfaces”.

This paper presents the first contract-based approach to ensure information-flow properties specifying which information a software/hardware component can observe or to interfere with while interacting with another component.

Each year, the “ETAPS EASST Award'' is assigned to the best paper of all ETAPS conferences (ESOP, FASE, FoSSaCS and TACAS) related to the systematic and rigorous engineering of software and systems. This year ETAPS has received 362 submissions in total and 111 of them were accepted.
